```javascript
let x = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, -2, -7, -9];
console.log(x.sort((a, b) => b - a));
```
he sort() method takes an optional comparison function that determines the order of the elements in the sorted array. In this case, the arrow function (a, b) => b - a is used as the comparison function.

This function subtracts a from b, so if b is greater than a, the result will be a positive number, which indicates that b should come before a in the sorted array. On the other hand, if b is less than a, the result will be a negative number, which indicates that a should come before b in the sorted array.

By subtracting b from a instead, the array would be sorted in ascending order.

When this code is executed, the sorted array is printed to the console:

```javascript
[ 5, 4, 2, 2, 1, -2, -7, -9 ]
```
As you can see, the array is sorted in descending order, with the largest number (5) coming first and the smallest number (-9) coming last.
