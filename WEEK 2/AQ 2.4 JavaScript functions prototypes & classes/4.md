```javascript
x = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, -2, -7, -9]
console.log(x.sort((a, b) => a - b))
```
The code you provided is JavaScript code that sorts an array of numbers in ascending order and logs the sorted array to the console. Here's what each part of the code does:
```javascript
x = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5, -2, -7, -9]
```

This line declares an array called x and initializes it with 8 elements.

```javascript
console.log(x.sort((a, b) => a - b))
```
This line sorts the array x in ascending order using the sort() method, which takes a comparator function as an argument. The comparator function (a, b) => a - b subtracts b from a, so the sort() method will sort the array in ascending order. The sorted array is then logged to the console using the console.log() method.

The output of this code would be:

```javascript
[-9, -7, -2, 1, 2, 2, 4, 5]
```

Note that the original array x is modified by the sort() method, so if you were to log x after sorting it, you would see the sorted array.
